##  Data Management

### AsyncStorage Keys

| Key | Data Stored |
|-----|-------------|
| `@user` | Array of registered users |
| `@currentUser` | Currently logged-in user object |
| `@complaints` | Array of all complaints |
| `@staff` | Array of staff member names |

### Data Persistence

- **All data persists** across app restarts
- **Device-specific**: Data is stored locally on each device
- **No backend required**: Fully functional offline
- **Mock data**: Sample complaints are auto-generated on first launch

### Data Structure

**User Object:**
```javascript
{
  id: "student_1234567890",
  email: "john@example.com",
  password: "password123",
  name: "John Doe",
  roomNumber: "204",
  role: "student"
}
```

**Complaint Object:**
```javascript
{
  id: "complaint_123",
  title: "Broken WiFi in Room 204",
  description: "WiFi has been down for 3 days...",
  category: "Internet",
  status: "open", // open | in-progress | resolved | closed
  priority: "high",
  studentId: "student_1234567890",
  studentName: "John Doe",
  roomNumber: "204",
  createdAt: "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",

      text: "Same issue here!",
      author: "Jane Smith",
      createdAt: "2025-01-15T11:00:00.000Z"

  'Internet',
  'Cleaning',
  'Security',
  'Food',

##  Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. **Port Already in Use**
```bash
# Kill the process and restart
npx expo start --clear
```

#### 2. **Module Not Found Error**
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npx expo start -c
```

#### 3. **AsyncStorage Warnings**
These warnings are normal and don't affect functionality:
```
Warning: AsyncStorage has been extracted from react-native core
```
**Solution**: Already using `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` ✅

#### 4. **Navigation Error**
```bash
# Ensure all navigation packages are installed
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack @react-navigation/bottom-tabs
npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context react-native-gesture-handler
```

#### 5. **Expo Go Not Connecting**
- Ensure phone and computer are on the same WiFi network
- Try scanning QR code again
- Restart Expo development server
- Restart Expo Go app

#### 6. **Build Errors on iOS**
```bash
# Clear iOS build cache (Mac only)
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
npx expo start -c
```

#### 7. **White Screen on Launch**
```bash
# Clear all caches
npx expo start -c
# Also clear Expo Go app cache in settings
```
